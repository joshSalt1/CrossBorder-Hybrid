# CrossBorder-HybridCross-Border Payments (Hybrid, Compliance-Anchored)

A small, pilot-ready blueprint for a hybrid blockchain approach that anchors tamper-evident receipts on-chain while keeping KYC/AML, liquidity, and payouts on mature banking rails. The aim: lower cost, faster settlement, and transparent evidence—without weakening regulatory assurance. Inspired by lessons from Ripple and Stellar, applied pragmatically.

This is intentionally simple—just enough to show the concept. It’s designed to scale into larger, production-grade systems with time and discipline.

Why This Project

Cross-border payments are still too expensive, slow, and opaque. This repo demonstrates a practical middle path:

Use blockchain selectively (for tamper-evident receipts and deterministic legs).

Keep sensitive operations on reliable, regulated rails.

Wrap everything in measurable governance (ERR gates, KRIs, and change logs).

Features

Quote → Decide → Execute → Receipt flow (Streamlit UI).

Tamper-evident receipts: SHA-256 hash of the evidence; full evidence remains off-chain.

Synthetic benchmarks comparing incumbent vs. blockchain-assist lanes (histograms + KPI summary).

CLI receipt verifier to recompute and compare hashes.

Clear Security/Privacy guidance; no real PII in-repo.

Quickstart
# (optional) create a virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

Benchmarks & Charts

Generate cost/time distributions and a KPI summary:

python benchmarks.py


Outputs:

figures/*.png — histograms for incumbent vs. blockchain-assist

data/kpi_summary.json — median/p95 time and average cost deltas

Quote → Receipt Demo (UI)

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py


Enter an amount and click Quote to see side-by-side estimates.

Click Save Receipt to write a tamper-evident receipt:

A JSON snapshot (evidence) is kept locally for demo.

The SHA-256 hash of that evidence is saved inside receipts/receipt_*.json.

In production, only the hash would be anchored on-chain; full evidence stays off-chain (private), ready for auditors and supervisors.

Verify a Receipt (CLI)

Match the stored hash in a receipt with the recomputed hash of evidence:

python scripts/verify_receipt.py receipts/receipt_*.json --evidence data/kpi_summary.json


Example output:

Receipt hash: <hex>
Evidence  hash: <hex>
RESULT: MATCH


If you modify the evidence JSON, you’ll see MISMATCH—that’s the tamper-evidence working.

Architecture

Hybrid approach (inspired by Ripple/Stellar models, adapted for corridor pilots):

Quote — return cost %, FX spread, ETA (p50/p95).

Decide — pick a route that satisfies compliance checks and SLO targets.

Execute — move funds with idempotent writes and clean reconciliation.

Receipt — hash of the evidence is anchored; full evidence remains off-chain.

This balances determinism + auditability with privacy + regulatory comfort and is built for corridor-specific, incremental rollout.

Governance: ERR + KRIs

ERR (Ethics & Risk Review): a lightweight gate for changes (pricing, partner swap, model update) and for KRI threshold breaches.

KRIs (early warnings):

Partner uptime/error envelope

Fee Regressivity Index (small tickets)

ETA p95 breaches

Screening false-positive rate
ERR decisions are recorded with rationale and rollback plans.

Security & Privacy

No real PII in this repo.

Receipts contain only a hash (e.g., sha256(evidence.json)).

Keep secrets and API keys out of source control (.env, GitHub Actions secrets).

In production: enforce RBAC, encrypt at rest/in transit, and follow evidence retention policies.

Roadmap

 Add “receipt viewer” page (paste hash → verify against stored evidence)

 Add stress tests (FX spikes, partner brownouts)

 Publish a receipts spec (fields, hash rules, sampling policy)

 Optional Git LFS for large images

 CI for lint + unit tests (hashing and I/O)
